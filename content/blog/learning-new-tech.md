# Learning New Tech

While I was building this portfolio alongside other projects, both public or private, in my spare time, I came to realize (once again) how refreshing it feels to learn something new after years on end using the same Laravel/Vue.js stack to maintain the projects I'm handling at my job.

## Things I've Read Or Tried Just Recently

**Python**
- I'm slowly pushing through FreeCodeCamp's course and I'm currently halfway done.

**React**
- I followed the basic tutorial project to make my very own Tic-Tac-Toe game.

**Next.js**
- I was inspired by websites like The Unsent Project and I'm currently building my very own project just like it using the Next.js framework and what I've learned from React and Node.js.

**Google Cloud Platform**
- To study more about deployment procedures and all the cloud platform stuff, I redeemed the free credits that Google offers for a limited time in order to both run a Postgre DB instance (which my anonymous letter project is going to use) as well as running their App Engine platform to serve both my frontend and backend. 

**Framer/Motion**
- It's really inspiring to see the portfolios of other web developers and designers. Thinking of how far I can push my creations if I were to adopt even a fraction of their quality motivates me to apply it to my own projects as well but first I'll have to study them and build my skills slow and steady.

It's pretty interesting to see how much stuff there is to unpack that my curriculum in STI didn't show or even mention throughout my time studying there. Though 5 years from now, I'll surely be adept in using all the juicy tech I can get my grimy hands on.
